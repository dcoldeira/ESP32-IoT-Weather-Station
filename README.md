# ESP32 IoT Weather Station

This is a project to build a weather station using the ESP32 microcontroller and various sensors. It is designed to collect data on temperature, pressure, and altitude, and transmit it wirelessly to a server for display and analysis.

## Features

- Measures temperature and pressure using BMP180 sensor
- Displays data on a web-based dashboard
- Uses ESP32 board for connectivity and control
- Expandable to include other sensors

## Installation

To use this project, you will need the following:

- ESP32-WROOM-D32 board
- BMP180 sensor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- 0.96 OLED Display Module
