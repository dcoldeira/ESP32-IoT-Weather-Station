# ESP32 IoT Weather Station

This is a weather station project that uses an ESP32 WROOM 32D board and a BMP180 sensor to measure temperature and pressure, and displays the data on a web-based dashboard. The project can be expanded to include other sensors like humidity or wind speed in the future.

## Features

- Measures temperature and pressure using BMP180 sensor
- Displays data on a web-based dashboard
- Uses ESP32 board for connectivity and control
- Expandable to include other sensors

## Installation

To use this project, you will need the following:

- ESP32-WROOM-D32 board
- BMP180 sensor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Usage

1. Connect the ESP32 board and the BMP180 sensor to the breadboard as described in the project documentation.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE and upload the code to the ESP32 board.
3. Connect to the Wi-Fi network using the ESP32 board.
4. Access the web-based dashboard to view the temperature and pressure readings.
